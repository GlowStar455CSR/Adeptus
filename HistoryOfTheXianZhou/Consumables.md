### **空间站「黑塔」|Herta Space Station**
#### 拓扑加速带|Topological Acceleration Band
黑塔空间站的万有应物科进行过一次有趣的实验：在一条拓扑循环带上，科员们对巡猎石施加了3利尔他的向量，使巡猎石将自身作为追逐的目标。于是，这枚巡猎石在特定环境下实现了有限永动。对于这一实验造成的命途能量损失，万有应物科并未在意，反倒是一个小现象引起了他们的注意：源于对命途的践行，永动的巡猎石速度虽然缓慢，但确实地在提升。应物科员应用这一原理制造出了拓扑加速带，目前而言，除了拿来健身以外，还没有找到别的用途。
*「假设量产这玩意，量产无限多个，有没有可能掏空一整条命途的能量？」*   
*「不知道…我们对命途的原理还所知甚少。」*   
The Department of Implement Arts of the Herta Space Station once did an interesting experiment. Its researchers added three Aidens of vector to a Stone of The Hunt on a topological loop band, making the stone chase itself. Thus, the stone was able to achieve limited perpetual motion under specific conditions. The department was not concerned with the loss of Path power in the experiment. Instead, they took notice of another small phenomenon: to tread on its Path, the stone moved at a very low velocity, but the speed was gradually picking up in small increments. The researchers leveraged this and produced Topological Acceleration Band. Other than for workout purposes, its use is very limited at the current stage.   
*"Say, if we mass-produce it, like,infinitely, could it drain all the energyof a certain Path?"*
*"No idea… Currently,we don't knowmuch about how Paths work."*

### **雅利洛-VI|Jarilo-VI**
#### 永冬碑石|Stone From the Everwinter Monument
很久很久以前，「悲悼伶人」来到雅利洛-Ⅵ。彼时星核尚未降临，寒潮也没有来到，只有反物质军团的战火无情地落在这颗脆弱的小星球上。「悲悼伶人」不知筑城者的存在，只见到满目疮痍。在星球的上方，贡多拉静静漂浮。伶人们在军团发现之前离去，留下一曲无声的哀歌。   
后来，贝洛伯格的筑城者们发现了一种美丽的石头，闪烁五彩光华。他们将这种石头混杂地髓建造了一座纪念碑。据说，这座纪念碑至今仍屹立在雅利洛-Ⅵ——贝洛伯格——克里珀堡的中心。   
*「即使我们失败了，这座纪念碑也会永世长存。未来或许会有新的人类来到这里，他将知道：我们曾经存在过。」*   
The Mourning Actors came to Jarilo-VI a long time ago when the Stellaron had not appeared on the planet, nor was there the blight known as the Eternal Freeze. The only threat this fragile little planet was facing was the merciless war with the Antimatter Legion. The Mourning Actors were not aware of the Architects. The only sight they witnessed was the trail of destruction left by the Legion. They rowed their gondolas quietly above the planet and left before the Legion could notice them, leaving behind a silent eulogy.   
Time flew by and the Belobog Architects found a type of beautiful stone that glimmered with bright colors. They mixed the stone with Geomarrow and built a monument, which some say still stands at the heart of Qlipoth Fort in the city of Belobog.   
*"Even if we fail, this monument willstand for all eternity.Those whocome after will find it and know thatwe had once existed."*

在堆满机械残骸的坟场里，未来的「帝皇」鲁珀特一世觉醒了。此时的它只有一个破烂的逻辑单元，一颗老旧的马达，九十吉字节的空余记忆空间，和一只仅有一指能够弯曲的工业手臂。三十个系统时后，鲁珀特用一次性动力炮轰开坟场顶部的铁门，爆炸的气浪使它的逻辑单元严重受损，但「帝皇」知道：它得到了掌握命运的力量。   
*「用作生产的机械和用作破坏的机械，是平等的。」*   
In a graveyard full of scraped machines, Rubert I the future emperor awoke. It had nothing more than a damaged logic unit, an old engine, a RAM with 90 GB left, and a robotic arm that had 1 movable finger. A loud blast was heard 30 system hours later — Rubert had busted open the iron gate at the top of the graveyard with a disposable kinetic cannon. The shock wave of the explosion damaged its logic unit even more, but Rubert knew that it now held destiny by its throat.   
*"All machines were born equal,bethose made for creation or destruction."*

#### 万寿无情丹|Longevity Pill of Cruelty
仙舟「曜青」的独门秘方，能提升服用者的体质，短时间内百病不侵。   
曜青流传着这样一则稗史：曾有一位玉姓医师与停留仙舟的狐人行商相恋。然而持明寿长千年，狐人远远不及。医师不愿与爱人天人永隔，竟在药王秘传的蛊惑下，诱骗狐人服下了丰饶的长生秘方。不幸沦为孽物的狐人失去了对医师的恋心，终为云骑所诛。玉姓医师因此悲痛欲绝。为防其提前堕入魔阴身，丹鼎司令其服用万寿无情丹，断情绝欲，直至寿终。   
该稗史还有另一个版本，称医师并非持明而是人类，狐人乃是药王秘传的使者，接近医师意图在丹鼎司中埋入奸嫌之种。该版本由于政治意味较浓，缺乏爱情元素，在仙舟并不流行。   
*「至情至性者堕入魔阴，断情绝欲者寿至千年。试问魔阴何患，千寿何喜？」*   
A medicine exclusive to the Xianzhou Yaoqing, said to have the effect of improving overall fitness and rendering those who take it immune to all diseases for a short period of time.   
On the Yaoqing, legend holds that a healer who went by the name of Yu fell in love with a Foxian trader girl. But the Vidyadhara race could live for a thousand years, much longer than the Foxians. Yu searched for ways to release his lover from the grip of death. He fell for the trickery of the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus and asked his lover to take the longevity medicine of the Abundance without telling her what it was. The Foxian girl turned into an abomination that no longer loved him before being slain by the Cloud Knights. To prevent Yu, who was overwhelmed by grief, from becoming mara-struck, the Alchemy Commission ordered him to take the Longevity Pill of Cruelty that deprived him of love and desire until his demise.   
The legend has another version, in which Yu was not of the Vidyadhara race but a mere mortal, and the Foxian girl was a spy planted by the Disciples to infiltrate the Alchemy Commission. This version is not as popular, for it turns a romance story into a power struggle.   
*"Longevity is a curse when life isdeprived of passion and desire."*
